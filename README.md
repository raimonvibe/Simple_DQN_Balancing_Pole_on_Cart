# Deep Q-Learning with CartPole in Google Colab 🐍🤖🎢

This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** to solve the classic **CartPole** problem using reinforcement learning. It is designed to run seamlessly in **Google Colab**.

---

## Overview 📖

The goal of the CartPole problem is to balance a pole on a moving cart by applying forces to the left or right. This project uses a DQN to learn the optimal policy for balancing the pole.

### Key Features
- **Environment**: OpenAI Gym's CartPole-v1
- **Deep Q-Network (DQN)**: Implements a neural network to approximate the Q-value function.
- **Google Colab**: Fully configured for Colab with TensorFlow or PyTorch.
- **Visualizations**: Displays rewards and performance metrics over episodes.
